# Simple Isn't Easy

[Simple Made Easy Talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)
_I know this talk can be rather dry and long, but do your best to stay engaged. Write down any terms you don't know and look them up after the talk is over._

## Deliverables
I want you to answer a few questions about the talk in your post. 
  - What is simple? 
  - What is easy? 
  - What is the value in putting prior thought into design our objects and systems?
