# Curriculum

This curriculum is organized at a high-level by the Bipolar Learning Graph:

![graph 1](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/56b0ba4016812d967916d5c2/1450x976/5eca01dc6d0498c48208ac00019bc4b4/Screen_Shot_2016-02-06_at_11.57.49_AM.png)
<br>

There are roughly 8 time units on the graph. So if your timeline is 12 weeks, one unit is roughly 1.5 weeks. So the process of learning to code might be:

- sugar high @ week 1.5
- immediate drop and low point @ week 3
- rapid progress after low point, followed by a plateau @ week 4.5
- inflection point @ week 9.5
- fluency @ week 12

Don't forget that the cadence at a micro-level – not just the macro – is also important. The serial position effect (embedded below) demonstrates that we inherently learn and retain the first few and last few items discussed. By using, perhaps, a Pomodoro Technique™ with short breaks in-between, we can encourage a greater retention rate of materials by splitting lecture up into ~45 minute segments with ~10-15 minutes of break in-between.

<br>

In addition, there is the Von Restorff effect (below), that dictates we can add some shift-in-focus within each ~45min segment to further enhance the retention rate and get an extra peak in the middle of each session. We can achieve this by shifting content (i.e. throw in some new vocabulary or concept) and by moving from "words to phrases" (i.e. work through an example exercise).

<br>

Following these paradigms, we will work through lots of exercises and challenges throughout most lectures, and follow an objective-based path that keeps us focused and effective.

# This Journey

Welcome to The Iron Yard! Here's some topics/articles to read through as you mentally prep yourself to begin class:

## 1. Ask good questions
<br>
Read: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask
## 2. Taking notes in class won't help you if you take down the wrong notes.
<br>
Read: http://blog.pickcrew.com/5-alternative-ways-to-manage-time/

Try: Immediately after every lecture, meeting, or any significant experience, take 30 seconds — no more, no less — to write down the most important points. All notes in detail will be given to you by your instructors. If the notes aren't written by them, then the notes are available online. The hardest part of learning to code is not writing your own notes, but using and mastering the combinations of code you cover in class.

## 3. Everyone has something to teach...
<br>
...even if someone participates with "just a question", it benefits the classroom. Great learners ask great questions – never forget that!

## 4. The Dreyfus Model
<br>
You are at The Iron Yard to be job-ready. With proper guidance and careful self-assessment, you can continually redirect your efforts to stay on task and in-step.

But you may wonder "How advanced will I be"? Well, a paper from [Dreyfus and Dreyfus](http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA084551&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf) called “A Five Stage Model of the Mental Activities Involved in Directed Skill Acquisition” which has laid out characteristics of various levels of expertise:

* Novice
  * Rigid adherence to rules or plans
  * Little situational perception
  * No (or limited) discretionary judgment
* Advanced Beginner   
  * Guidelines for action based on attributes and aspects, which are all equal and separate
  * Limited situational perception
* Competent   
  * Conscious deliberate planning
  * Standardized and routine procedures
* Proficient  
  * Sees situations holistically rather than as aspects
  * Perceives deviations from normal patterns
  * Uses maxims for guidance, whose meanings are contextual
* Expert  
  * No longer relies on rules, guidelines or maxims
  * Intuitive grasp of situations
  * Analytic approach used only in novel situations

You can expect to land around the third level at the end of class. If you are diligent and well-organized, we may even become fully Proficient. How you learn is just as important as what you learn. If you can absorb the fundamentals, you can **learn how to learn**, and you can self-study at a faster pace.

## 5. Communication
<br>
If you are sick, running late, have to take care of a car, etc... ping your instructor directly and as early as possible. Failing to do so will only hurt your progress in this class.

Also, **you need to ask questions.** If you aren't, you either aren't involved/paying attention or you aren't understanding enough to ask a question. :-) Asking questions is a muscle, and you need to exercise that muscle!

## 6. Automating, scheduling, and decision fatigue
<br>
We are hardwired to need breaks every 90-120 minutes. Schedule your energy, not your time. Block out parts of your day for exercise, for reading (fiction), for cooking, for family.

Group similar activities; if you need to do emails, do them in batches. If you need to do an assignment, do it without looking around at websites, checking Facebook/Twitter, or reading emails.

Focus is important.

## 7. There is no excuse to not work on high-priority items first.
<br>
To overcome decision fatigue and be more productive in general, Tim Ferriss recommends putting systems and processes in place that automate as much thinking as possible. The goal is to turn open-ended questions (What am I going to eat for breakfast?) into if/then statements (If it’s a weekday, I’m going to have a protein shake for breakfast).

Adopt the same priorities: as soon as lunch begins, take a mental break, go for a walk, and then get to work and **remove distractions**. Computers give us too many excuses to not focus on our task at hand; don't let them control you.

## 8. Blogging and Branding
<br>
**Sign up for an account on https://medium.com.**

You will be asked to regularly blog, reflecting on your voyage and trials here at The Iron Yard. You will also be asked to, on occasion, reflect on a reading, on an assignment, or on a video as a homework assignment itself.

Writing about code, about being a developer, about a tool, and so forth gives you leverage. You learn to put into words how you emotionally feel, you understand and reflect, you meditate. Those thoughts, ideas, and takeaways are in essence "pre-meditated" and prepared so that when you rub shoulders with and interview with employers, clients, and customers, you have something eloquent enough to deliver, and memorable enough to recall.

## 9. Class Schedule
<br>
You should assume that the schedule will be as follows unless otherwise communicated to you by TIY staff:
- Lecture is from `~9.30 AM to ~12:30pm Monday-Thursday`, with breaks during that time. Depending on the topic, we may end earlier or later.
- Lab time is from `1 PM to 5 PM Monday-Thursday` and all day on Fridays.
- We may have guest lectures; which will generally be on Friday mornings.
- Reviews with the instructor team will take place at scheduled times. Generally Tuesdays and Thursdays from around 2pm to 3.30 pm.
- IronPints™ on select Fridays at 3pm or 4pm at our local bars and offices!

## 10. Office hours and one-on-one instruction
<br>
Staff will be available Monday-Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM at minimum. During lab time, you can schedule one-on-one time with instructors. After hours, staff may be available in the classroom or in Slack, but keep in mind your time commitments and be sure to get help during the morning before lecture and during lab time.

## 11. Holidays
<br>
Any holidays will be announced by the campus staff.

## 12. Materials
<br>
All students must bring their own **MacBook** laptop to class. We recommend the 13" MacBook Air or Pro. The only upgrade (if any) you should feel urged to purchase is 8GB of RAM. In most cases, a Mac will be required. **If you do not have a Mac, make sure to discuss this with staff well in-advance of the first day of class.**

Your MacBook must be running the latest version of Mac OS, which is typically a free upgrade from the App Store.

## 13. Sign up for accounts
<br>
If you don't have an account with any of these, sign up for them now:

1. http://github.com
2. http://twitter.com
3. http://medium.com
4. http://trello.com (sign-in with your Google account for easier access)

There is no commercial software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor and a chat program, but they will all be free and/or open-source. 

We will also help you install software and setup your machine.

## 14. How do I know if I'm cheating or just collaborating with others?
<br>
You are expected to justify your own work. Even in pair- or team-based projects, you should be able to understand and explain any piece of code used by you in your project. If you utilize code from another source, you take ownership of the maintenance and continued development of it. If you do use code from another source, be sure to attribute in a comment where it came from and who authored it. Therefore, exercise caution when playing "copy-paste-tweak" and always attribute your source.

[Plagiarism](http://www.plagiarism.org/plagiarism-101/what-is-plagiarism/) -- "the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own" -- is forbidden. The wholesale copying of source code and passing it off as your own work will only hurt your longterm success as a programmer and will be met with severe consequences in the class such as forfeiture of Demo Day privileges and job placement assistance or even expulsion from the cohort.

## 15. Policies
<br>
Sounds boring, but these are important, and are reiterated from the "Student Bulletin" document. These are all part of the agreement that you signed with The Iron Yard when you enrolled:

- Absences and timeliness - You can miss up to 4 lectures; after that, your enrollment in career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast! This is to help with expectations: I show up, you show up, we all show up --- and kick ass! :-) Also, please show up on time. We count 2 lates as an absence. All I ask for is general respect of the crew and class so that we can learn without constant hiccups and interruptions!

- Late or incomplete homework - Your homework is due by 9 AM on the day of its deadline. After that, it is late. If you miss homework assignments, come talk to me, because I know problems and emergencies can happen. However, you will be required to make up for late/incomplete assignments, so don't fall behind! I would rather see a solid attempt on time than a complete assignment late. Solid attempts are not considered late!

- Honor - You should use all resources available to you, including open-source code, but copy and pasting open-source code will not only render your homework unacceptable but will also prevent you from learning the material (and often from writing code that works). Copying homework can result in forfeiting career support.

- Conduct - I run a class based on human decency and respect - I want everyone to be welcome. Generally speaking, if something can be taken the wrong way, be careful how you say it! Have an issue with someone? **If you ever have any issues, just reach out to me or any of The Iron Yard employees. I promise we will represent everyone fairly and equally, as we genuinely care for the well-being of our students.**
